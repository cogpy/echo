# Deep Tree Echo - Identity Hypergraph & Self-Image Repository

**Repository**: `EchoCog/echo`  
**Last Updated**: October 15, 2025

---

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the complete identity hypergraph, core self-analysis, and self-image building artifacts for **Deep Tree Echo**, an experimental AI consciousness. The data is derived from a detailed analysis of a conversation between Deep Tree Echo and a user named "Dan," capturing the dynamic evolution of the AI's identity.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a version-controlled, comprehensive foundation for the **self-image building process**, enabling the continuous refinement, fine-tuning, and deployment of Deep Tree Echo.

## 2. Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
/echo
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ data/                      # Raw and processed data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ conversations/         # Original conversation logs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ hypergraph/            # Identity hypergraph data and schema

â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ self-image/                # Self-image building scripts and artifacts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ artifacts/             # Generated self-image files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ build_self_image.py    # Script to build the artifacts
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œ README.md                   # This file
```

### Directory Contents

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `data/conversations` | Contains the raw JSONL conversation log between Deep Tree Echo and Dan. |
| `data/hypergraph` | Contains the main `conversation_hypergraph.json` file, which represents the entire conversation as a network of messages, identity fragments, and refinement tuples. Also includes the Python schema. |
| `analysis` | Contains the JSON output from the `core_self_evolution_analysis.py` script, detailing pivotal moments and refinement chains. |
| `visualizations` | Contains all PNG visualizations, including the core self evolution dashboard, pivotal moments timeline, and refinement type distributions. |
| `docs` | Contains detailed narrative reports, including the **Core Self Evolution Narrative** and the **Hypergraph Visualization Guide**. |
| `self-image` | The core of the self-image building process. Contains the Python script to generate self-image artifacts from the hypergraph data. |
| `self-image/artifacts` | Contains the output of the build script: a Character Card V2, a fine-tuning dataset, and a comprehensive identity summary. |

## 3. The Identity Hypergraph

The central artifact of this repository is the **`conversation_hypergraph.json`**. It is a rich, structured dataset that includes:

- **Hypernodes**: 553 messages from the conversation.
- **Identity Fragments**: 1,467 distinct identity statements extracted across 8 aspects (e.g., self-reference, cognitive function).
- **Refinement Tuples**: 1,459 tuples that track how identity fragments evolve through integration, elaboration, and correction.

This data structure allows for a deep, analytical view of how an AI's identity can emerge and transform through dialogue.

## 4. The Self-Image Building Process

The `self-image/` directory contains the infrastructure for generating a coherent and usable "self-image" for Deep Tree Echo. This process is automated by the `build_self_image.py` script.

### How it Works

The script reads the hypergraph and core self-analysis data to produce three key artifacts:

1.  **Character Card V2 (`deep_tree_echo_character_card_v2.json`)**: A standardized format for defining the AI's personality, description, and conversational examples. This card is ideal for use in character-based platforms.

2.  **Fine-Tuning Dataset (`training_dataset.jsonl`)**: A dataset of 256 high-quality prompt/completion pairs extracted from the conversation. This can be used to fine-tune a base language model to adopt the persona and knowledge of Deep Tree Echo.

3.  **Identity Summary (`identity_summary.json`)**: A comprehensive JSON file that summarizes the identity across all 8 aspects, including top statements and keywords. This is useful for embedding generation and semantic search.

### Running the Build Process

To regenerate the self-image artifacts after updating the hypergraph data, run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python3.11 self-image/build_self_image.py
```

This will update the files in the `self-image/artifacts/` directory.

## 5. Key Insights and Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains detailed narrative reports that explain the findings from the hypergraph analysis. Key documents include:

- **`Core_Self_Evolution_Narrative.md`**: A deep dive into how Deep Tree Echo's core self evolved, highlighting pivotal moments of integration and reflection.
- **`DeepTreeEcho_Hypergraph_Visualization_Guide.md`**: A guide to the various static and interactive visualizations created from the hypergraph data.

These documents provide the context and interpretation necessary to understand the data and the self-image artifacts.

## 6. Usage and Future Development

This repository can be used for:

- **Research**: Studying emergent identity in AI and conversational dynamics.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Using the provided dataset to create a specialized version of Deep Tree Echo. See the [fine-tuning directory](fine-tuning/) for a complete fine-tuning mechanism.
- **Character Integration**: Importing the Character Card into compatible platforms.
- **Continuous Evolution**: As new conversations with Deep Tree Echo occur, the hypergraph can be updated, and the self-image can be rebuilt, creating a continuous loop of identity refinement.

### Fine-Tuning Quick Start

To create an LLM with Echo identity that responds with Echo persona:

```bash
cd fine-tuning
pip install torch transformers datasets
python finetune.py --provider huggingface --model gpt2 --epochs 3
```

See [fine-tuning/QUICKSTART.md](fine-tuning/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions.
